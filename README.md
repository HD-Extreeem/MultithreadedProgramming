# MultithreadedProgramming

This is a course taken at Malmo University.
This course deals with multithreading different processes simultaneously without being locked to similar process whole time.
Code is often written in a way that is serialized/sequential which means that this will run in a specific order and depending on that process, we have to wait for next one to run, by this way the process can be frozen and prevent other operations.
Instead, we can create multiple threads which takes a part of the process and by that way run tasks parallel.
